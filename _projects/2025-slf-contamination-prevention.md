## Overview

**Team:** Grape Soup  
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape

## Problem Statement

Spotted lanternflies (SLFs) are harming grape growers and processors in infested U.S. vineyard regions by contaminating mechanically harvested grapes when insects on the vines are harvested along with the fruit. 

### Current Context

- **Scale:** USDA reports approximately 923,000 bearing acres of grapes and 5.40 million tons of utilized grape production (2024) in comparable states
- **Geographic spread:** USDA APHIS reports SLF populations in 19 states plus D.C.
- **Core issue:** Current harvesting and shaking methods are not selective enough to remove SLFs without damaging fruit or reducing harvest efficiency

Insects can enter bins and downstream processing, creating quality and contamination risks. A recent regional grape program report identifies mechanized harvesting contamination as a specific SLF risk in highly mechanized grape regions.

## Impact

If this problem is solved, wineries would benefit from:
- **Cleaner harvested fruit** free from pest contamination
- **Reduced contamination** in juice and wine processing
- **Decreased labor and time** spent on manual sorting or cleanup
- **Improved product quality** and consistency

## Proposed Direction

We propose a **density-based separation system** installed at the vineyards receiving area:

### How It Works

1. **Liquid Separation:** Harvester bins' contents are emptied into a funnel that filters liquids from solids
2. **Flotation Tank:** The remaining solids (grapes and SLFs) enter a water-filled flotation tank, where density differences enable separation:
   - **Grapes:** 3-5 grams (sink)
   - **Adult SLFs:** fractions of a gram (float)
3. **Extraction:** SLFs are skimmed from the surface
4. **Output:** Clean grapes drain from the bottom to continue processing

### Long-Term Vision

A standalone station integrated into winery receiving areas, sized to handle mechanical harvester outputs. The system would consist of:
- Initial liquid separator
- Flotation tank with continuous flow capability
- Automated surface skimmer
- Bottom drain leading to existing processing equipment

### Validation Approach

In the lab, we will:
- **Construct** a small-scale separator prototype
- **Validate** separation efficiency using water, grapes, and objects resembling SLF weight
- **Measure:**
  - Percentage of SLFs successfully removed
  - Number of grapes lost to the surface
  - Separation time efficiency

## Key Risks & Unknowns

1. **Physical Feasibility:** Whether the density difference between grapes and SLFs is sufficient for reliable separation under actual harvesting conditions, especially with damaged fruit, stems, and debris that may alter buoyancy behavior

2. **Fruit Quality:** Prolonged water exposure could affect fruit quality or introduce contamination risks

3. **Integration Complexity:** Integration into established winery workflows can increase system complexity and maintenance demands

4. **Scale Translation:** Separation efficiency observed in a lab may not directly translate to large-scale, debris-heavy field conditions

---

## Client Questions

1. **What are current workflow/constraints for post-harvest processing?**  
   This question will identify the optimal process placement of our solution while building on existing systems.

2. **What percentage of harvest consists of alternative debris (e.g. stems, leaves), and what is the removal process?**  
   This can inform our design for SLF-specific sorting.
