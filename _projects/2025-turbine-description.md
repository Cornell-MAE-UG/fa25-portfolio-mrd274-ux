A steam turbine converts the thermal energy of high-pressure, high-temperature steam into mechanical shaft work. It is a core component of the Rankine cycle and is widely used in power plants (coal, natural gas, nuclear), industrial cogeneration systems, and geothermal plants.

## How it works (conceptual overview)

1. High-pressure steam enters the turbine through a nozzle. The nozzle converts thermal energy into kinetic energy.
2. The high-velocity steam impacts a series of rotating blades, producing impulse and/or reaction forces that turn the rotor.
3. Steam expands through multiple stages; its pressure, temperature, and enthalpy decrease while the rotor gains mechanical energy.
4. The rotating shaft drives a generator to produce electricity.
5. Low-pressure steam exits to a condenser, where it is condensed back to liquid and returned to the cycle.

## Design change considered

One common performance change is increasing the turbine inlet temperature while keeping the inlet pressure constant. This simple modification has several effects on performance and component life.

## Effect on performance

- Increased inlet enthalpy (h1) raises the enthalpy drop across the turbine, which typically increases the work output.
- Raising inlet temperature tends to reduce the moisture fraction at the turbine exit, lowering the risk of blade erosion and improving durability.
- Overall thermodynamic efficiency generally improves because the expansion more closely approaches an ideal isentropic process.
- Trade-offs: higher temperatures increase material stresses (creep and fatigue), require better cooling and higher-cost materials, and may reduce component life if not mitigated.

## Conclusion

Increasing the turbine inlet temperature is an effective way to increase power output and efficiency, but it must be balanced against material limits and long-term durability concerns.
