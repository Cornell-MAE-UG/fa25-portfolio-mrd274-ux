A steam turbine is a device that converts the thermal energy of high-pressure, high-temperature steam into mechanical shaft work. It is a core component of the Rankine cycle, which is widely used in power plants (coal, natural gas, nuclear), industrial cogeneration systems, geothermal plants, etc.


How It Works (Conceptual Overview):

 -> High-pressure steam enters the turbine through a nozzle.
    – The nozzle converts thermal energy → kinetic energy.

 -> The high-velocity steam impacts a series of rotating blades imparting impulse and reaction forces.

 -> As steam expands through multiple stages, its pressure, temperature, and enthalpy drop while the rotor gains mechanical energy.

 -> The shaft of the turbine drives a generator, producing electricity.

 -> Low-pressure steam exits to a condenser, where it becomes saturated liquid to complete the cycle.

One change that can be made to the device is increasing the turbine inlet temperature while keeping pressure constant. 

Effect on Performance: 
 -> Higher h1 -> increased enthalpy drop -> higher work output
 -> Lower moisture content at exit, reducing blade erosion
 -> Efficiency inreases because the process more closely approaches an ideal isentropic expansion
 -> Trade off: Material limitations (creep, blade fatigue)

Conclusion: Increasing inlet temperature improves turbine output and effiency until material limits are reached.
