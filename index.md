My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore at Cornell University pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on design, modeling, and data-driven analysis. I am passionate about bridging mechanical systems, simulation, and embedded technology to develop innovative and functional solutions, and it is my dream to work in the space exploration industry.
